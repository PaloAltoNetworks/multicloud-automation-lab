Cloud Monitoring
===================

In this activity you will:

- Create a VM Information Monitoring profile (AWS or GCP)
- Create a Dynamic Address Group
- Update a security rule with the DAG

The automation tasks we've accomplished thus far have focused on deploying the VM-Series firewall and making changes to it externally via the API.  We'll now shift our focus to how PAN-OS can leverage third-party APIs to monitor its environment and respond to changes it observes.
